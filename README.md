# Haffel

This project formalises an affine type and effect system for a language with effect handlers
and proves type safety for it.

# Overview 

There are two source directories, `src` that has examples of using effect handlers
in OCaml 5 and `theories` which gives the affine type and effect system.

The project depends on `coq-hazel` a language with effects and effect handlers,
together with its embedding in `iris` that allows us to reason about programs written in Hazel.

# Installation

Run `install.sh`
